2. The free k-Wave MATLAB toolbox must also be previously installed following the instructions at http://www.k-wave.org/installation.php

3. Download the file AscanEye.mlappinstall in your computer. Then, instal the App double clicking on AscanEye.mlappinstall. After installation has been completed the AscanEye icon will appear in the APPS menu of MATLAB

RUNNING

1. Before runs the App, the k-Wave folder must be added to the search path in the MATLAB command Window:

addpath('/Users/.../Documents/MATLAB/k-Wave') for Mac OS

addpath('C:\...\Documents\MATLAB\k-Wave') for Windows

2. The matrix "eye.mat" must be saved in the current folder

3. Open the app by double clicking in the AscanEye icon. Then, you will be able to configure the simulation by choosing the parameters in the bottom commands. Once the configuration has been selected, press the START button to runs simulation. At this moment a green lamp will turn on.

4. When simulation has finished, the green lamp turns off and the simulation results are presented in the graph and numeric indicators.

5. For closing the app just click on the Red Cross at the top-left of the app windows.
